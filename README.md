## For this project I have considered the goal to identify high-potential customer segments and regions for targeted marketing campaigns to increase bike sales.

## Key Business Questions:
 - Which demographics are more likely to purchase bikes?
 - How does average income affect bike buying behavior?
 - Which commute distances are common among buyers?
 - Which age groups are the primary customers?

## What I find out?
 - On average, customers who purchased bikes had higher incomes.
 - Middle-aged customers were the largest buyer group.
 - Most customers who purchased bikes lived within 0â€“1 miles of their work location.

The dashboard allows dynamic filtering by region, education level, and marital status, helping businesses refine insights for specific campaigns
